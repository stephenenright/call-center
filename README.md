#Call Center

A simple project that can connect to a third party web socket and store the
response into a priority queue. A Rest API is provided to return the next item 
from the queue


#Improvements 

* A reactive stack could be used such as Spring Webflux with Kotlin, to simplify the programming model and improve the scalability.
* A persistence / storage mechanism could be used to store the queue instead of in memory.
